# Not a silver bullet

Solving complex problem -> Breaking them down into smaller sub problems

Ek agar ek bar solve krliya hai toh uska reference rkhlo taki dobara solve krna naa pade

# In DP, solve each sub problems just once
# Store result in Table
# Avoid Recomputation

# Types of DP

1. Top Down with memoization
    - Break problem at the top level
    - Recursive -> with table to store result

2. Bottom Up with Tabulation
    - Consider smaller problem first
    - solutions are typically built iteratively and are stored in a table (array)
    - Iterative + Table to store
